*** Dependencies ***

To run, multidupehack requires the Boost library. Most of GNU/Linux
distributions have it in their repositories. Simply use your package
manager to install it. Notice however that Debian and its derivatives
(including the *buntu) split that library into several packages. If
you run one of them, you must install libboost-dev,
libboost-program-options and libboost-program-options-dev.

To manually install the Boost library (for example if you are running
a proprietary operating system), this Web page may help you:
http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/index.html


*** Compilation ***

multidupehack was meant to be built with GCC version 4.7 or
later. However one can easily adapt the makefile to use another
compiler.

To install multidupehack on a *NIX-like operating system, run (with
administrator privileges):
# make install

If you do not have access to administrator privileges or if you do not
run a *NIX-like operating system, simply run:
$ make
The executable, called multidupehack, is created in the working
directory. You can then move it to a personal directory listed in your
PATH variable.


*** Compilation Options ***

Several options can be easily enabled (respectively disabled) in
Parameters.h by uncommenting (respectively commenting) them:

* OUTPUT turns on the output. This option may be disabled to evaluate
the performances of multidupehack independently from the writing
performances of the disk.

* MIN_SIZE_ELEMENT_PRUNING turns on the heuristic that removes from
the search space individual elements that would necessarily make a
pattern violate some minimal size or area constraint

* ENUMERATION_PROCESS selects the procedure that decides what is the
dimension the next enumerated element is taken in:
0: choose the dimension first, then choose the element w.r.t the noise
it introduces in the potential part of the search space
1: choose the dimension first, then choose the element w.r.t. the
noise it introduces in the present part of the search space (in
present and potential in case of equality)

* VERBOSE_PARSER turns on the output (on the standard output) of
information when the input data and group files are parsed.

* DEBUG turns on the output (on the standard output) of information
during the extraction of the closed error-tolerant n-sets. This option
may be enabled by someone who wishes to precisely understand how this
extraction is performed on a small data set.

* VERBOSE_DIM_CHOICE turns on the output (on the standard output) of
information regarding the choice of the next dimension to be
enumerated. Combined with DEBUG, this option may be enabled by someone
who wishes to precisely understand how this choice is performed on a
small data set.

* NB_OF_CLOSED_N_SETS turns on the output (on the standard output) of
how many closed error-tolerant n-sets were selected during the
extraction phase.

* NB_OF_LEFT_NODES turns on the output (on the standard output) of how
many patterns were considered during the extraction phase, i.e., the
count of valid (but not always maximal) patterns with regard to the
applied constraints. This option may be enabled by someone who wishes
a measure of the time complexity independent from the hardware
performance.

* TIME turns on the output (on the standard output) of the running
time of multidupehack.

* DETAILED_TIME turns on the output (on the standard output) of a more
detailed analysis of how the time is spent. It gives (in this order):
- the parsing time
- the pre-processing time (to reduce the relation)
- the mining time
- the post-processing time (to agglomerate the closed error-tolerant
  n-sets)
- the time spent checking the closedness of the computed
  error-tolerant n-sets
- the time spent searching for irrelevant elements
- the time spent cleaning the set of absent elements

* GNUPLOT modifies the way NB_OF_CLOSED_N_SETS, NB_OF_LEFT_NODES, TIME
and DETAILED_TIME (in this order) format their outputs. Instead of
being human readable, they are directly understandable by the famous
gnuplot software.

Please notice that some of these options may considerably alter the
performances of multidupehack. For example one could think that
DETAILED_TIME does not really slow multidupehack but it does!
