/* OUTPUT turns on the output. This option may be disabled to evaluate the performance of multidupehack independently from the writing performances of the disk. */

// Heuristics
/* MIN_SIZE_ELEMENT_PRUNING turns on the heuristic that removes from the search space individual elements that would necessarily make a pattern violate some minimal size or area constraint */

/* ENUMERATION_PROCESS selects the procedure that decides what is the dimension the next enumerated element is taken in: */
/* 0: choose the dimension first, then choose the element w.r.t the noise it introduces in the potential part of the search space */
/* 1: choose the dimension first, then choose the element w.r.t. the noise it introduces in the present part of the search space (in present and potential in case of equality) */

/* VERBOSE_PARSER turns on the output (on the standard output) of information when the input data and group files are parsed. */

/* TIME turns on the output (on the standard output) of the running time of multidupehack. */

/* - the parsing time */
/* - the pre-processing time (to reduce the relation) */
/* - the mining time */
/* - the post-processing time (to agglomerate the closed error-tolerant n-sets) */
/* - the time spent checking the closedness of the computed error-tolerant n-sets */

// Assert
/* ASSERT is used to check the correctness of the computed noise counters. At every iteration, it prints the counters associated with every remaining element and the same element computed from the data. Because floating points operations are not accurate, small differences are normal. */
